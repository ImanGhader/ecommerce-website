	<h2>About our company</h2>

	<p>Beit Laila has been running for just over a year now and has recently re launched with a brand new image and brand new collections!</p>

	<p>With the vintage market on the rise to popularity each year we've found it sometimes frustrating that the prices for vintage seem to have risen greatly too! Or shop is here to provide all you vintage lovers the perfect pieces for the perfect prices! Keeping it real with our funky finds, and painless price tags. After all, we want your experience to be different to that on the high street! Our shop is a collection of carefully hand picked or customised vintage items from the 20s all the way up to the 90s! A lot of our vintage items are great finds that we know some of our creative customers will love to use to re work or customise themselves.</p>

	<p>Eventually by the end of the year, we hope to have re leased a whole clothing line that we're working on as of now so keep your eyes peeled!</p>
